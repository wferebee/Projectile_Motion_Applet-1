# Projectile_Motion_Applet-1


* The projectile motion applet is a work in progress. At this point the user can shoot a projectile across the screen at different power levels and angles.

* I built this applet to see if I could take my background in physics and apply it to webdesign. After some reasearch and learning how to use the Canvas element, I was able to code in the actual projectile displacment formulas. 
* y = Y(inital position)  +  V(inital velocity) x (time elapsed) x sin(theta)  + (1/2)A(acceleration due to gravity) x (time) x (time)

## Still to Come:
* gameify the applet 
* build targets
* set a game timer
* allow the user one Tracer style projectile
* music
* possible different levels to the game
